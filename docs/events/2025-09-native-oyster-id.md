::: info
**Focus:** Field identification, ecology, documentation, and ethical collection of *Pleurotus ostreatus*.  
**Hands-on lab work:** Demo-only using sealed, pre-sterilized kits (no open culturing).
:::

## What you’ll learn
- Key identification traits of *Pleurotus ostreatus* (macro features, habitat, seasonality).
- Common look-alikes and how to avoid misidentification at a high level.
- Ethical & legal considerations: where/when/what to harvest, minimal-impact collection.
- How to document finds for science (photos, notes, coordinates) and submit observations.
- High-level overview of sterile technique concepts and commercially prepared kits for at-home learning.

## Who this is for
- Educators, community stewards, and beginners interested in fungi ecology and safe, ethical foraging.
- Intermediate foragers seeking stronger ID confidence and documentation practices.

## Safety & Ethics (Read first)
- **Never consume** any wild mushroom unless identification is independently confirmed by qualified experts.  
- Follow local laws and land-use rules; obtain permission where required.  
- Harvest sparingly; leave the substrate and surrounding habitat undisturbed.  
- Handle specimens gently and keep different samples **separately labeled** to avoid mix-ups.  
- Respect allergies/sensitivities: some participants may react to spores—consider masks/gloves outdoors.

## Field Session (high-level plan)
1. **Habitat scouting (overview):** Downed hardwoods and standing deadwood; shaded, moist microclimates.  
2. **Macro features to note:** 
   - Shelf-like clusters; variable oyster-shaped cap.
   - Gills that **run down the stem** (decurrent) or very short/absent stem.
   - Typically pale to grayish tones; firm, not brittle.
   - Odor often mild; texture elastic rather than chalky.
3. **Look-alike awareness (concepts only):**  
   - **Jack-o'-lantern** (*Omphalotus* spp.)—orange coloration, bioluminescent tissues; **do not harvest**.  
   - **Angel wings** (*Pleurocybella porrigens*)—thin, delicate; regional cautions apply.  
   - **Late oyster** (*Sarcomyxa serotina*)—olive to yellow-green hues.  
   When uncertain, photograph thoroughly and **do not collect for any consumption.**
4. **Documentation basics:**  
   - Photograph **in situ** (cap, gills, side profile, substrate).  
   - Note date, location (approximate coordinates), substrate type (tree species if known).  
   - Collect a **single** representative specimen per find for teaching; keep it labeled.

## Indoor Session (demo-only, no open culturing)
We’ll demonstrate **concepts** of sterile handling using **sealed, pre-sterilized educational kits** (commercially prepared).  
- Topics: workspace cleanliness principles, labeling, sample handling ethics, and how commercial kits are designed to protect users.  
- Take-home: a list of reputable kit suppliers and local community labs/courses to continue learning safely.

::: warning
**No DIY culturing protocol provided here.**  
For safety and compliance, this workshop does **not** include actionable instructions for preparing liquid culture, jars, or home culturing. Use commercially prepared kits or attend accredited classes for hands-on training.

## Materials to Bring (field)
- Weather-appropriate clothing, sturdy shoes.  
- Small notebook & pencil; phone or camera for photos.  
- Disposable gloves (optional), a few paper bags or rigid specimen boxes; **labeling tape & marker**.  
- Hand lens (10×) if you have one; optional ruler for scale in photos.  
- Water/snacks; respect Leave-No-Trace principles.

## Accessibility & Weather
- Terrain may include uneven ground and downed logs; we’ll keep routes short and opt-in.  
- If heavy rain or fire restrictions apply, we’ll pivot to a classroom-style identification session.

## Pre-reading (optional, high-level)
- Local mycology society guidelines on ethical collecting.
- Regional field guide entries for *Pleurotus* spp.
- Basics of photographing diagnostic features for community science.

## Code of Conduct
We operate with mutual respect, safety first, and a commitment to habitat stewardship and scientific integrity.
