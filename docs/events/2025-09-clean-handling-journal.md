::: info
**Scope:** This session covers high-level concepts for keeping materials organized and clean, understanding contamination risks, and maintaining a robust mycology journal.  
**No home lab build or DIY sterile box instructions are provided.** For hands-on lab work, use an accredited community lab or sealed, commercially prepared educational kits.
:::

## Objectives
- Understand what “clean handling” means in principle and why it matters.
- Recognize common contamination **risk factors** (e.g., dust, drafts, mixing samples).
- Learn a rigorous **journaling** and **labeling** practice that improves outcomes in any setting.
- Explore safer paths for hands-on learning (community labs, sealed kits).

## Safety & Compliance
- Follow local laws, land-use rules, and institutional policies.
- Avoid performing biological procedures outside controlled facilities.
- Never ingest or distribute any wild materials.
- When in doubt, choose observation and documentation—not manipulation.

## Clean Handling: Conceptual Checklist (Non-Actionable)
- **Dedicated time & space:** Plan short, focused sessions; reduce interruptions and foot traffic.
- **Separation of concerns:** Keep personal items away from work materials; handle one labeled item at a time.
- **Label first, handle second:** Labels on containers and pages before you touch any material.
- **Single-direction workflow:** Arrange your materials so each item moves through your process only once.
- **Minimal disturbance:** Avoid creating air movement over sensitive materials; keep motions deliberate.
- **Stop on uncertainty:** If anything is unclear (mix-up, unlabeled item), pause and document before proceeding.

## Recommended Learning Paths
- **Community lab course:** Book bench time and instruction at a local community biology lab or university extension.
- **Sealed educational kits:** Use vendor-prepared, sealed kits designed to teach sterile concepts safely without open procedures at home.
- **Documentation-first field work:** Pair field identification workshops with strong journaling and photo documentation.

## Mycology Journal Template
Use a bound notebook or digital system that timestamps entries. Treat each sample as a “case file.”

### Page Header
- **Observer(s):**  
- **Date & Time:**  
- **Location (general):**  
- **Weather / Conditions:**  

### Sample Record (repeat per sample)
- **Sample ID:** (e.g., YYYYMMDD-LOC-001)  
- **Collection Context:** (substrate, habitat, coordinates if appropriate)  
- **Suspected Genus/Species:**  
- **Photos:** (file names or links; include cap, gills/pores, side profile, substrate)  
- **Notes:** macro features, odor (if any), color changes, insects present, etc.  
- **Chain of Custody:** where the sample goes (e.g., observation only; submitted to community lab; archived)

### If Using Sealed Educational Kits (Demo-Only)
- **Kit ID / Lot:**  
- **Supplier:**  
- **Intended Learning Goal:** (e.g., “observe how labeling and single-item flow reduce mix-ups”)  
- **Outcome Notes:** what was learned about organization and process, not biology per se.

### Observational Red Flags (Conceptual)
- **Mix-ups:** labels missing, two items with same ID, unclear container origin.  
- **Environmental risks:** visible dust, strong air currents, pets/food near materials.  
- **Process drift:** handling multiple unlabeled items at once, back-tracking items.

### Follow-Up
- **Next Steps:** (e.g., schedule mentored session at a community lab)  
- **Open Questions:**  
- **References Consulted:** (field guides, society notes, non-procedural articles)

## Session Flow (45–60 min)
1. **Intro & Safety Framing (10 min):** What clean handling means; why we avoid DIY sterile builds at home.  
2. **Labeling & Journal Demo (15 min):** Practice IDs, consistent formats, cross-referencing photos.  
3. **Risk-Factor Walkthrough (10 min):** Identify conceptual risks in mock scenarios; decide when to pause.  
4. **Sealed Kit Concept Demo (10–15 min):** Show how sealed educational materials illustrate clean handling principles without opening or operating any culture steps.  
5. **Q&A & Next Steps (10 min):** Community lab options, society meetups, and reading list.

## What to Bring
- Bound notebook or tablet for notes.
- Pre-printed labels or tape + marker.
- Phone/camera for documentation (macro mode helpful).
- Weather-appropriate clothing for brief outdoor observation (if applicable).

## Code of Conduct
We practice safety, respect, and habitat stewardship. When uncertain, we document and defer to trained facilities—not DIY procedures.
