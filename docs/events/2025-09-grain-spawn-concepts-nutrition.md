::: info
**Scope:** Conceptual overview of grain spawn as a propagation material, risk-awareness for contamination, ethical sourcing, and a nutrition discussion for *Pleurotus* spp. and *Hericium erinaceus*.  
**Not included:** Step-by-step instructions for producing or inoculating grain spawn, DIY sterile methods, temperatures, timings, or troubleshooting for culturing. For hands-on practice, use accredited community labs or sealed educational kits from reputable vendors.
:::

## Learning Goals
- Understand what grain spawn **is** and why cultivators use it.
- Recognize contamination **risk factors** conceptually and how workflow/organization reduces risk.
- Identify **ethical, safe sourcing** paths (commercial spawn, community labs, sealed kits).
- Learn high-level **nutrition** aspects of oyster and lion’s mane mushrooms and what influences them.

## Safety & Compliance
- Follow all local laws and land-use rules.  
- Avoid biological procedures outside appropriate facilities.  
- Never ingest wild-harvested materials without expert verification.  
- When uncertain, choose documentation and consultation over action.

## Grain Spawn — High-Level Concepts
- **Purpose:** Grain spawn is a nutrient-bearing carrier of living mycelium. It allows **scaling** from a verified source to a larger substrate with even distribution.  
- **Qualities people look for:** clean appearance, consistent colonization, correct labeling (species/strain/lot), and intact packaging from a reputable supplier.  
- **Why organization matters:** Clear labeling and single-direction workflow prevent mix-ups and reduce opportunities for contamination.  
- **Contamination risks (conceptual):** Dust/aerosols, reusing unlabeled containers, handling multiple unlabeled items in parallel, or backtracking items through your workspace. Good documentation and separation of tasks lower these risks.

### Sourcing (Safer Paths)
- **Commercial grain spawn:** Purchase from vetted suppliers with lot tracking and storage guidance.  
- **Community lab courses:** Learn practical technique in controlled settings with mentorship and proper infrastructure.  
- **Sealed educational kits:** Observe inoculation and growth principles without open handling or DIY sterile builds.

## Nutrition — Pleurotus & Hericium (High-Level)
- **Macronutrients (dry basis):** Both oyster and lion’s mane are typically high in **protein** (often reported in the ~20–35% range of dry weight), **fiber** (notably β-glucans and chitin), and low in fat.  
- **Micronutrients:** Often good sources of **potassium, phosphorus**, some **B vitamins**, and antioxidant compounds like **ergothioneine** (oysters commonly cited). Lion’s mane fruiting bodies are studied for unique compounds (e.g., **hericenones** in fruiting bodies; **erinacines** more associated with mycelium).  
- **Culinary/functional notes:** Texture and mild flavors make oysters versatile; lion’s mane can be “seafood-like.” Any health-related claims should be approached cautiously and sourced from peer-reviewed research.

### What Can Influence Nutritional Profile (Conceptual)
- **Genetics / strain:** Different isolates emphasize different growth rates, textures, and metabolite patterns.  
- **Substrate composition:** Mineral and lignocellulosic diversity can shift micronutrient content and polysaccharide profiles. (Avoid substrates from contaminated sources; fungi can bioaccumulate metals.)  
- **Developmental stage:** Harvest timing (immature vs. mature fruiting bodies) can change moisture, texture, and certain constituents.  
- **Postharvest handling:** Storage conditions, dehydration approach, and cooking methods affect measurable nutrients and sensory quality.

> **Note:** If you plan to compare nutrition across grows, partner with a certified lab for compositional analysis. Keep a chain-of-custody and detailed journal to interpret results meaningfully.

## Journaling & Labeling (Improves Outcomes Anywhere)
Use a bound notebook or digital system that timestamps entries.

**For each material you handle or observe:**
- **ID:** (YYYYMMDD-LOC/LOT-###)  
- **Source:** supplier/community lab; lot/batch where applicable  
- **Intended species/strain:** *Pleurotus ostreatus*, *P. pulmonarius*, *P. djamor*, *Hericium erinaceus*, etc.  
- **Storage & condition on receipt:** date, temperature context (room-cool-cold), any visible issues  
- **Observations over time:** appearance, aroma notes, firmness (non-invasive checks), packaging integrity  
- **Disposition:** used for demo only, archived, or returned to cold storage  
- **Photos/links:** label images and any macro shots for internal QC review

## Session Outline (60–75 min)
1. **Concepts Overview (15 min):** What grain spawn is, why it’s used, and how workflow reduces risk.  
2. **Contamination Risks (10 min):** Conceptual risk map—dust, drafts, parallel unlabeled handling—and why labeled, single-direction flow matters.  
3. **Sourcing & Ethics (10–15 min):** How to evaluate reputable vendors, understand lot information, and when to choose community labs.  
4. **Nutrition Deep Dive (15–20 min):** High-level review of macronutrients, micronutrients, and factors that can influence them; cautions about health claims.  
5. **Journal & Labeling Demo (10–15 min):** Build a consistent ID system; cross-reference photos; example of a mini “QC checklist” for received materials.  
6. **Q&A & Next Steps (5–10 min):** Finding local societies, lab partners, and reading lists.

## Pre-Reading & Resources (Non-Procedural)
- Regional mushroom field guides and mycology society pages.  
- Introductory articles on fungal nutrition and culinary use (non-instructional).  
- Vendor documentation for sealed educational kits and community lab course syllabi.

## Code of Conduct
We prioritize safety, legal compliance, and habitat stewardship. When in doubt, document and consult qualified experts.
